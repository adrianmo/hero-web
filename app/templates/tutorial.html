            <h3>Step 1: Access OpenStack and activate your Hero</h3>

            <p>Once you receive the <a href="{% url 'registration' %}">registration</a> email with your credentials. Use the Horizon URL to access OpenStack.</p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/horizon-login.png' %}" style="width: 30%">

            <p>Replace "hero_XYZ" with your domain and username received in the registration email.</p>

            <p>Now that you are in the Horizon UI, let's create an instance (VM) in OpenStack. Under Compute, click on
                <b>Instances</b>, and then click on <b>Launch Instance</b></p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Compute-instances.png' %}">

            <p>You are now presented with the Launch Instance wizard. Enter a name for your instance, for example <b>hero-vm</b>
                and click <b>Next</b>.</p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Launch-Instance-1.png' %}">

            <p>In the next screen you will select the image that will be used to boot the VM. Click on the <b>plus (+)</b>
                sign next to "hero-ubuntu" and click <b>Next</b>.</p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Launch-Instance-2.png' %}">

            <p>In the next screen is where you specify the flavor for the VM, in other words, the resources that the VM will be
                created with. Select <b>m1.tiny</b> and click <b>Next</b>.</p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Launch-Instance-3.png' %}">

            <p>In the next screen of the wizard you will select what networks will the VM be connected to. Select <b>default_network</b>.</p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Launch-Instance-4.png' %}">

            <p>Click <b>Next</b> four times until you get to the <b>Configuration</b> step.</p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Launch-Instance-5.png' %}" width="80%">

            <p>Copy the following script and paste it into the <b>Customization script</b> window.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <i>
                  #!/bin/bash<br>
                  set -x<br>
                  <br>
                  # Activate hero<br>
                  export HERO_NAME=<b style="color:red">Enter-Your-Hero-Name-Here</b><br>
                  # Hero token you received after registration<br>
                  export HERO_TOKEN=<b style="color:red">Your-Emailed-Token-Here</b><br>
                  <br>
                  curl -si -H "X-Auth-Token: ${HERO_TOKEN}" http://192.168.104.10/hero/${HERO_NAME}/activate<br>
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Replace the values with your <b style="color:red">Hero name and token</b> from the registration email.</p>

            <p>Now click on <b>Launch Instance</b>. After a few seconds, the VM will show with status as <b>Active</b>
                and Power State <b>Running</b>.</p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Instance-Ready.png' %}">

            <p>After a few minutes, your Hero should be active and playing the game.</p>

            <hr class="col-md-12">

            <h3>Step 2: Getting to know VxRack Neutrino</h3>

            <p>Now, we are going to log into the Neutrino system that is located in the Dell EMC booth and take a look at how the system is performing today.</p>

            <p>Click on the Neutrino URL on the registration email and login using <b style="color: red;">"default" as Account</b> and your provided OpenStack username and password. This user has the Cloud Monitor role and is able to explore all the reports in the system.</p>

            <h4>Explore the Neutrino dashboard</h4>

            <p>The Dashboard displays the overall VxRack Neutrino system status. Each tile displays a certain aspect of
                the VxRack Neutrino system. This view provides a quick read-only overview of the health, cloud compute,
                and storage resources in the VxRack Neutrino system.</p>

            <p>The Dashboard is divided into six tiles:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Health</b>- provides health status information on the VxRack Neutrino infrastructure (nodes, disks,
                    networks, storage) and software services (Platform and Cloud Compute).
                </li>
                <li><b>Node</b> Allocation - a donut chart displays the used and unallocated (unused) nodes in the VxRack
                    Neutrino system using colored segments.
                </li>
                <li><b>System</b> - displays information about the installed version, the aggregate memory of all the nodes and
                    the aggregate block storage capacity of all the nodes in the VxRack Neutrino system.
                </li>
                <li><b>Alerts</b> - lists notifications for VxRack Neutrino system components that may require the Cloud
                    Administrator's attention. Each alert listed contains a brief message description, timestamp, and
                    severity.
                </li>
                <li><b>Cloud Compute Service</b> - provides information on the OpenStack environment: Instances (Virtual
                    Machines), vCPUs, Memory and Storage
                </li>
                <li><b>Storage</b> - provides information on block storage capacity use for cloud compute purposes via a donut
                    chart and IOPs/bandwidth information for the block storage system via a dynamic graph
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Explore the reports</h4>

            <p>Now that your VM is ready, you will go back to the Neutrino UI and explore some of the reports about
                Performance, Capacity and Chargeback in your OpenStack cloud.</p>

            <p>Go back to the tab were you had the Neutrino UI. Then navigate to <b>Reports->Performance</b></p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Reports-Performance.png' %}">

            <h4>Performance Reports</h4>

            <p>Performance Reports are organised in three categories: Infrastructure, Cloud Compute and Accounts.
                Infrastructure is subdivided in Storage, Network and Platform. Take some time to explore these reports.
                Here we show the <b>Infrastructure->Network</b> view that provides performance details for all network
                switches and ports in the platform</p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Reports-Performance-Infrastructure-Network.png' %}">

            <p>Now move to <b>Cloud Compute</b>. This set of reports will show you performance information about your
                OpenStack environment. It is subdivided in Nodes (Hypervisors), Instances, CPU Utilization and Memory
                Utilization. Feel free to navigate around.</p>

            <h4>Capacity Reports</h4>

            <p>You will now explore the capacity related reports. Navigate to <b>Reports->Capacity</b>.</p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Reports-Capacity.png' %}">

            <p>This report category is subdivided in three different categories: Infrastructure, Cloud Compute and
                Accounts. It provides information about capacity consumption and forecast of all components in the
                platform. Feel free to navigate around. Here we show an example screenshot of the <b>"Cloud
                    Compute->Compute Nodes current</b> report". This page provides several tables with the current
                allocation of all nodes in the system.</p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/Reports-Capacity-CloudCompute.png' %}">
